Galaxy
======

Galaxy builds many Stars (graphs), measures pairwise distances between them, clusters, and then selects representative graphs per cluster.

Highlights
----------

- Fit: generate Stars over your parameter grid
- Collapse: compute distances (curvature filtrations), cluster (Agglomerative), select reps
- Coordinates: get a 2D layout (MDS) for quick visual sanity checks

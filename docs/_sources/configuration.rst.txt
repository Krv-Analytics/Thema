THEMA: Core
=======

The ``Core`` class is a data container class used for modeling in THEMA, working in the background so users don't have to. It provides access to three versions of the user's data: raw data, cleaned data, and projected data. This class is inherited by almost everything in THEMA, providing a central data handling mechanism to manage data in the background.
